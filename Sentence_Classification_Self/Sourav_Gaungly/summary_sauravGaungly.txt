In his recently released memoir, A Century Is Not Enough, Sourav reveals everything that happened when he took over as India captain in 2000.In his five years as captain between 2000 and 2005, he pulled India up from #8 to #2 in the ICC rankings.He charted a new trajectory for Indian cricket and built a team capable enough to traverse that path.He says that in the aftermath of the match-fixing scandal that shocked the nation and the global cricketing fraternity, his well-wishers handed him a copy of former English captain Mike Brearley’s leadership bible — The Art of Captaincy.He went on to develop his own style of leadership and a very effective one at that.By the time he hung up his boots, the Ganguly School of Captaincy had become a thing, and one to emulate.Sourav had the knack of unearthing great talent.What followed was even better.He would back these players to the hilt, give them enough confidence to fail, and see them evolve into match-winners who could single-handedly take the team home. Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan — Ganguly made men out of all these boys.Sourav explains a captain’s conviction in his book.Each of them went on to have remarkable careers and contributed significantly to India’s victories at home and abroad, and eventually became a part of the team that lifted the World Cup in 2011.Sourav Ganguly is a name that polarised Indian cricket fans like possibly no other.While he claims an irrefutable place in the pantheon of the game, criticism was a leitmotif in his 12-year-long international career.He took it chin up, of course — first as player and then as captain.His greatest legacy, and there is no polarisation here — is that of a leader.It was being taught at management schools in India and presented at corporate organisations and events.Even today, Ganguly is called to deliver talks on corporate leadership where he draws parallels from cricket.That three-match series saw him pick up 32 wickets, including a hat trick — the first ever by an Indian in the longer format of the game — at the historic Eden Gardens test.
