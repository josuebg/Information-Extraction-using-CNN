A proposal has been made for the solution of our difficulties in organising Indian independence and it is being accepted with whatever bitterness of regret and searchings of the heart by Indian leaders.
But do you know why this proposal has been made to us? It is to prove to us the absurdity of our quarrels.
And do you know why we have to accept these proposals? It is to prove to ourselves the absurdity of our quarrels.
Clearly, this is not a solution; it is a test, an ordeal which, if we live it out in all sincerity, will prove to us that it is not by cutting a country into small bits that we shall bring about its unity and its greatness; it is not by opposing interests against each other that we can win for it prosperity; it is not by setting one dogma against another that we can serve the spirit of Truth.
In spite of all, India has a single soul and while we have to wait till we can speak of an India one and indivisible, our cry must be: Let the soul of India live forever!  
The Soul of India is one and indivisible.
India is conscious of her mission in the world. She is waiting for the exterior means of manifestation.
