India has become the symbolic representation of all the difficulties of modern mankind.
India will be the land of its resurrection - the resurrection to a higher and truer life.
In the whole creation the earth has a place of distinction, because unlike any other planet it is evolutionary with a psychic entity at its centre.
In it, India, in particular, is a divinely chosen country.
From time immemorial India has been the land of spiritual knowledge and practice, of the discovery of the Supreme Reality and union with it.
It is the country that has practised concentration most and best.
The methods, called Yoga in Sanskrit, that are taught and used in this country are countless.
Some are merely material, others purely intellectual, others religious and devotional; lastly, some of them combine these various processes in order to achieve a more integral result.
From the spiritual point of view, India is the foremost country in the world.
Her mission is to set the example of spirituality.
Sri Aurobindo came on earth to teach this to the world.
Do not forget even for a moment that has been created by Him out of Himself.
Not only is He present in everything, but also He is everything.
The differences are only in expression and manifestation.
If you forget this you lose everything.
I would say, may the world become aware that the Divine is manifesting.
