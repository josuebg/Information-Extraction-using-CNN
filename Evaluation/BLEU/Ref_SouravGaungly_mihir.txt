Sourav Ganguly is a name that polarised Indian cricket fans like possibly no other. While he claims an irrefutable place in the pantheon of the game, criticism was a leitmotif in his 12-year-long international career. He took it chin up, of course — first as player and then as captain. His greatest legacy, and there is no polarisation here — is that of a leader. Sourav had the knack of unearthing great talent. What followed was even better. He would back these players to the hilt, give them enough confidence to fail, and see them evolve into match-winners who could single-handedly take the team home. A leader can be a control freak. Sourav’s career hit a roadblock in 2005-06 when he was removed as captain and even dropped from the national team. Nobody, besides him, believed that he could make a comeback. Not even his own family. His father wanted him to retire, reveals Dada in the book. Towards the end of 2008, the BCCI selection committee was tilting in favour of fresh blood. Several domestic players had burst into the scene in the inaugural edition of the IPL. He charted a new trajectory for Indian cricket and built a team capable enough to traverse that path. In his recently released memoir, A Century Is Not Enough, Sourav reveals everything that happened when he took over as India captain in 2000. He says that in the aftermath of the match-fixing scandal that shocked the nation and the global cricketing fraternity, his well-wishers handed him a copy of former English captain Mike Brearley’s leadership bible — The Art of Captaincy. He went on to develop his own style of leadership and a very effective one at that. In his five years as captain between 2000 and 2005, he pulled India up from #8 to #2 in the ICC rankings.
