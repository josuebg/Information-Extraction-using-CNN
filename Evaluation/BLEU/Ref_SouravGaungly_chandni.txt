Sourav Ganguly is a name that polarised Indian cricket fans like possibly no other. While he claims an irrefutable place in the pantheon of the game, criticism was a leitmotif in his 12-year-long international career. He charted a new trajectory for Indian cricket and built a team capable enough to traverse that path. In his recently released memoir, A Century Is Not Enough, Sourav reveals everything that happened when he took over as India captain in 2000. He says that in the aftermath of the match-fixing scandal that shocked the nation and the global cricketing fraternity, his well-wishers handed him a copy of former English captain Mike Brearley’s leadership bible — The Art of Captaincy. In his five years as captain between 2000 and 2005, he pulled India up from #8 to #2 in the ICC rankings. By the time he hung up his boots, the Ganguly School of Captaincy had become a thing, and one to emulate. Even today, Ganguly is called to deliver talks on corporate leadership where he draws parallels from cricket. Sourav had the knack of unearthing great talent. Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan — Ganguly made men out of all these boys. Each of them went on to have remarkable careers and contributed significantly to India’s victories at home and abroad, and eventually became a part of the team that lifted the World Cup in 2011. He had identified his on-ground soldiers and would let them be in critical situations. Sourav’s career hit a roadblock in 2005-06 when he was removed as captain and even dropped from the national team. Nobody, besides him, believed that he could make a comeback. Sourav’s undying self-belief led him to script one of the most remarkable comebacks sport has ever seen. Towards the end of 2008, the BCCI selection committee was tilting in favour of fresh blood. He made up his mind that the upcoming home series against Australia would be his last. Sourav always had the gift of timing. In retirement too, it was impeccable.
