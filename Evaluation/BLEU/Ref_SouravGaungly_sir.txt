Sourav Ganguly is a name that polarised Indian cricket fans like possibly no other. While he claims an irrefutable place in the pantheon of the game, criticism was a leitmotif in his 12-year-long international career.In his recently released memoir, A Century Is Not Enough, Sourav reveals everything that happened when he took over as India captain in 2000. He went on to develop his own style of leadership and a very effective one at that. In his five years as captain between 2000 and 2005, he pulled India up from #8 to #2 in the ICC rankings. By the time he hung up his boots, the Ganguly School of Captaincy had become a thing, and one to emulate. It was being taught at management schools in India and presented at corporate organisations and events. Even today, Ganguly is called to deliver talks on corporate leadership where he draws parallels from cricket. A leader can be a control freak. Several leaders lose the plot because they are so. Hence, man-management skills are essential in leadership. Sourav had a few. Sourav’s undying self-belief led him to script one of the most remarkable comebacks sport has ever seen. His ordeal went on to prove that even successful leaders aren’t assured of their berths in a team/organisation. Towards the end of 2008, the BCCI selection committee was tilting in favour of fresh blood. He had a whiff of what was about happen when he got left out of the Rest of India squad for a domestic fixture. After reaching Bengaluru, venue for the first test, Sourav announced his decision to quit to the press.Sourav always had the gift of timing. In retirement too, it was impeccable!
