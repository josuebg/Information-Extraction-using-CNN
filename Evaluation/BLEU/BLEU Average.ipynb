       " '“…India is the only place in the world which is still aware that something else than matter exists$ The other countries have quite forgotten it: Europe, America and elsewhere…$That is why she still has a message to preserve and deliver to the world$ But at present she is splashing and floundering in the muddle$ Sri Aurobindo has shown that the truth does not lie in running away from earthly life but in remaining in it, to transform it, divinize it, so that the Divine can manifest HERE, in this PHYSICAL world$” ( The Mother )\\n',\n",
