# Information Extraction using Convolution Neural Network

## About
> Information Extraction has been one of the important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The said task have been accomplished by using sophisticated machine learning algorithms like Nave Bayes.
We will try to approach the problem using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with least possible hyper parameter tuning on pre trained word vectors.
It is expected that we can reach our goal with considerable results using CNN that will be computationally much efficient than the traditional approaches.
